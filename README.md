# neighborhood-map

This is a React App that featuring a map of Athens. There are map markers to identify popular sights, as well as a dropdown menu function to easily discover these locations, and a list view to support simple browsing of all locations. Each marker provides additional information about each of these locations.

#How to run the app

1. Clone the repository.
2. You will need npm. If you have Node installed you have npm as well. If you don't have node, then install it from here https://nodejs.org/en/.
3.Run npm install and then npm start, both in the cloned repository folder. The second command will open a browser window on localhost:3000, which will have the app running.
